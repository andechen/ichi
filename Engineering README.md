# Current Status : May 5, 2023
The current state of the project is complete for the deliverables/goals we set out for this academic year, that being emulating computer mouse and keyboard functionalities with the use of a controller and Tobii Eye Tracker 5. As of right now, ICHI is compatible with Windows 10 OS.

## FUTURE improvements we’ve established: 

-  More **accurate** eye tracking camera and sensors with a **smaller gaze point area**
- Access gaze point data **outside of Unity** with more comprehensive eye tracker SDK
- Better **consistency & response time** from speech-to-text libraries to get results within 3 seconds of request, receive correct transcriptions in noisy environments, and capture punctuation
- Custom PCB to **shrink footprint** within the controller
- **Improved airflow** with a outtake fan to prevent overheating
- **Higher resolution 3D print** to improve strength of controller walls


## Warnings/Things To Keep In Mind:

- Approval is needed in order to download and use Tobii SDK 
- Tobii Eye Tracker 5 only works with Tobii Experience App open
    - Per user, make sure to re-calibrate eyes for accurate detection
    - It’s most compatible with PC gaming, which is best developing in Unity 
-Speak closely into the microphone to avoid speech-to-text picking up background noise
