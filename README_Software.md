## Bluetooth
To properly establish Bluetooth connection between the controller and the host PC, first set up a COM port on the host PC to recieve Bluetoooth communications through the PC's Bluetooth settings. From the "Bluetooth & other devices" settings page go to "More Bluetooth options." Under the "COM Ports" tab, click Add. Leave the options as "Incoming (device initiates the connection)" and click OK. Note the COM port number that has been designated. In the bt_client.py script (/ichi/client), edit the host_addr variable to be the host PC's MAC address and the port to be the aforementioned COM port. Now, when the controller is plugged in, it will bind and connect to the host PC.
